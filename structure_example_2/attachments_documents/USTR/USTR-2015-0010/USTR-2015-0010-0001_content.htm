[[Page 47986]]

1. Background

    China became a Member of the WTO on December 11, 2001. In 
accordance with section 421 of the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000 
(Pub. L. 106-286), USTR is required to submit, by December 11 of each 
year, a report to Congress on China's compliance with commitments made 
in connection with its accession to the WTO, including both 
multilateral commitments and any bilateral commitments made to the 
United States. In accordance with section 421, and to assist it in 
preparing this year's report, the TPSC is hereby soliciting public 
comment. Last year's report is available on USTR's Internet Web site 
(<a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2014-Report-to-Congress-Final.pdf">https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2014-Report-to-Congress-Final.pdf</a>).
    The terms of China's accession to the WTO are contained in the 
Protocol on the Accession of the People's Republic of China (including 
its annexes) (Protocol), the Report of the Working Party on the 
Accession of China (Working Party Report), and the WTO agreements. The 
Protocol and Working Party Report can be found on the Department of 
Commerce Web page, <a href="http://www.mac.doc.gov/china/WTOAccessionPackageNEW.html">http://www.mac.doc.gov/china/WTOAccessionPackageNEW.html</a>, or on the WTO Web site, <a href="http://docsonline.wto.org">http://docsonline.wto.org</a> (document symbols: WT/L/432, WT/MIN(01)/3, WT/
MIN(01)/3/Add.1, WT/MIN(01)/3/Add.2).

2. Public Comment and Hearing

    USTR invites written comments and/or oral testimony of interested 
persons on China's compliance with commitments made in connection with 
its accession to the WTO, including, but not limited to, commitments in 
the following areas: (a) Trading rights; (b) import regulation (e.g., 
tariffs, tariff-rate quotas, quotas, import licenses); (c) export 
regulation; (d) internal policies affecting trade (e.g., subsidies, 
standards and technical regulations, sanitary and phytosanitary 
measures, government procurement, trade-related investment measures, 
taxes and charges levied on imports and exports); (e) intellectual 
property rights (including intellectual property rights enforcement); 
(f) services; (g) rule of law issues (e.g., transparency, judicial 
review, uniform administration of laws and regulations) and status of 
legal reform; and (h) other WTO commitments. In addition, given the 
United States' view that China should be held accountable as a full 
participant in, and beneficiary of, the international trading system, 
USTR requests that interested persons specifically identify unresolved 
compliance issues that warrant review and evaluation by USTR's China 
Enforcement Task Force.
    Written comments must be received no later than Wednesday, 
September 23, 2015.
    A hearing will be held on Wednesday, October 7, 2015, in Room 1, 
1724 F Street NW., Washington, DC 20508. If necessary, the hearing will 
continue on the next business day. Persons wishing to testify orally at 
the hearing must provide written notification of their intention by 
Wednesday, September 23, 2015. The intent to testify notification must 
be made in the ``Type Comment'' field under docket number USTR-2015-
0010 on the <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> Web site and should include the name, 
address and telephone number of the person presenting the testimony. A 
summary of the testimony should be attached by using the ``Upload 
File'' field. The name of the file should also include who will be 
presenting the testimony. Remarks at the hearing should be limited to 
no more than five minutes to allow for possible questions from the 
TPSC.
    All documents should be submitted in accordance with the 
instructions in section 3 below.

3. Requirements for Submissions

written comments must do so in English and must identify (on the first

    The <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> Web site allows users to provide comments

submitting comments containing no business confidential information

possible, please include any exhibits, annexes, or other attachments in 
the same file as the submission itself, not as separate files.
    As noted above, USTR strongly urges submitters to file comments
